# CT Brain Temp (Location)

## How to Describe

### Lobes region

-  `[left | right | bilat]` {lobe} convexity (e.g., temporal convexity)

-  `[left | right | bilat]` `?-?` convexity (e.g., parieto-occipital convexity)

### Changes

**Series**

-   Chronological change of ___, now seen as ...

-   Sequelae of ___ seen as ...

**New:** There is development of ___

**Resolved:** There is resolution of ___


## Cerebral parenchyma

### Normal

The study reveals normal brain volume. The rest of the imaged cerebral parenchyma appears unremarkable. No new acute large territory infarction is identified.

### Brain Vol. loss

The study reveals:

diffuse brain volume loss, 

-  `appropriate for age`
-  `advanced more than age`

with normal gray-white differentiation of the brain parenchyma.

## Posterior fossa

**Cerebellum and posterior fossa:** Normal given a limited evaluation of the brainstem due to beam-hardening artifacts.

## Vascular system

### Athero

**Vascular system:** `[Mild | Moderate | Severe]` atherosclerotic change of the

-   ICAs
-   vertebrobasilar system

## Skull base/ sella / TMJ

**Skull base, sella and temporomandibular joints (TMJs):** Unremarkable.
