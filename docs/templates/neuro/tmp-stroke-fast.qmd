## Stroke CT Template

**EMERGENCY MDCT OF THE BRAIN (Stroke Fast Track)**

**HISTORY:** `[stroke onset]` `[symptoms and signs]` 

**TECHNIQUES:** Axial conventional scan of the brain with 4-mm slice thickness

-   **Intravenous contrast brand, concentration, volume:** Not used.
-   **Immediate complication:** None.
-   **Estimated radiation dose:**  ðŸ¤” mGy, ðŸ¤” mGycm. 

(Standard DRL recommended by the American College of Radiology and European Commission = 75 mGy, 1050 mGycm. Values reported for 16-32-cm PMMA phantom. Uncertainties associated with this method are approximately 20%.)

**COMPARISON:** None. 

**FINDINGS:**

-   **Cerebral parenchyma:** Normal.

-   **Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS):** `ðŸ¤”/10` or `N/A`. 

[insert number in case of suspected MCA stroke with [ONSET < 24 hours]{.red} or [WAKE-UP strokes]{.red} (= unknown stroke onset), otherwise use `N/A`]


-   **Cerebellum and posterior fossa:** Normal given a limited evaluation of the brainstem due to beam-hardening artifacts. 

-   **Posterior-fossa ASPECTS:** `ðŸ¤”/10` or `N/A`.

[insert number in case of suspected MCA stroke with [ONSET < 24 hours]{.red} or [WAKE-UP strokes]{.red} (= unknown stroke onset), otherwise use `N/A`]

-   **Extraaxial spaces:** Appropriate for age.
-   **Ventricles:** Appropriate for age. 
-   **Midline shift:** None.
-   **Brain herniation:** None. 
-   **Vascular system:** Normal. 
-   **Calvarium and scalp:** Normal.
-   **Skull base, sella and temporomandibular joints (TMJs):** Normal. 
-   **Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells:** Normal.
-   **Visualized upper cervical spine:** No fracture identified. 

**IMPRESSION:**  

- This is a **PRELIMINARY** report made by radiology physician trainees. It has [**not**]{.blue} been [**reviewed**]{.blue} by the attending radiologist.
- This is a **PRELIMINARY** report made by radiology physician trainees. The study has been [**REVIEWED**]{.blue} by the attending radiologist but the report is [**not yet finalized**.]{.blue} 

- No intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, acute large territorial infarction, midline shift or brain herniation identified.


**Door datetime:** `xx/xx/20xx xx:xx` [ER Check in time, seen in V/S page in EMR]. 

**CT datetime:** `xx/xx/20xx xx:xx xx:xx` [Time of the first image of plain CT].
