  abstractnote = {Sonography is often the first imaging procedure performed in the evaluation of individuals with suspected liver disease. Evaluation for biliary dilatation is always performed, because bile duct obstruction can cause abnormal liver test results, raising the suspicion of liver disease. Ultrasound is a useful but imperfect tool in evaluating diffuse liver disease. We discuss the uses and limitations of sonography in evaluating parenchymal liver disease. Sonography can show hepatomegaly, fatty infiltration of the liver, and cirrhosis, all with good but imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Sonography is of limited usefulness in acute hepatitis. Increased parenchymal echogenicity is a reliable criterion for diagnosing fatty liver. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed in the correct clinical setting when the following are present: a nodular liver surface, decreased right lobe-caudate lobe ratio, and indirect evidence of portal hypertension (collateral vessels and splenomegaly). Ultrasound plays an important role in the imaging of conditions and procedures common in patients with diffuse liver disease.},

  abstract = {The appearance of intracranial hemorrhage at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging depends primarily on the age of the hematoma and the type of MR contrast (ie, T1 or T2 weighted). As a hematoma ages, the hemoglobin passes through several forms (oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin) prior to red cell lysis and breakdown into ferritin and hemosiderin. Five distinct stages of hemorrhage can be defined: hyperacute (intracellular oxyhemoglobin, long T1 and T2), acute (intracellular deoxyhemoglobin, long T1, short T2), early subacute (intracellular methemoglobin, short T1, short T2), late subacute (extracellular methemoglobin, short T1, long T2), and chronic (ferritin and hemosiderin, short T2). The short T1 of methemoglobin is due to the paramagnetic dipole-dipole interaction. Another paramagnetic property, the magnetic susceptibility effect, is responsible for the short T2 observed when deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, or hemosiderin is intracellular. T2 shortening can also be produced by hemoconcentration and clot retraction. The T2 shortening due to magnetic susceptibility effects is enhanced on higher-field-strength systems and on gradient-echo images and is reduced with "fast spin-echo" MR techniques.},
