-   `___ unit in blah.`: e.g., 0.3 cm in thickness.

-   `Size = ___ `: e.g.
    -   **Isthmus:** Thickness = 2.0 mm. 

-   `object, measuring ___ unit`: e.g.
    -   **Left kidney:** Normal size and parenchymal echogenicity, measuring about 11.6 x 5.0 x 4.2 cm. 

## Size Change

**Full**

-   `[increase | decrease | No significant change]` (in size) of ðŸ¤”

**Abbreviated**

-   No changed of ðŸ¤” at ...

-   ðŸ¤” size ___, unchanged.

**Previous comparison**

-   measuring ðŸ¤” cm (from ? cm) 

-   measuring ðŸ¤” cm (previously ? cm) 

## Uncertain

### Uncertain amount

-   `[a few | several | innumerable]` + pleural countable n. (e.g., a few cysts)

-   `[small | large]` amount of + uncountable n. (e.g., small amount of free fluid)

### Uncertain measurement

-   `about ...`: measuring about 3 cm.

-   `size up to ...`: size up to 1 cm.

-   `ranging from ? - ?`: ranging from 0.4-1.0 cm.

-   ___ lesion of `vary in size`

**Note:** abbreviation of unit *do not* requires period (e.g., `cm`, `mm`, `ml`).



## New Lesion

-   A new ?-cm ðŸ¤” at â›°

-   Newly seen a ðŸ¤” at â›°

-   ðŸ¤” are seen, measuring about ___


##  Seen on

-   A seen best in/on ___ view.

##  Not seen

-   `without demonstrable cause of` ___. (e.g., w/o demonstrable cause of obstruction)

-   `without evidence of` ___. (e.g., GS w/o without evidence of cholecystitis)

-   There is `no evidence of` A.

-   `No demonstrated` ___. (e.g., No demonstrated caliceal stone at both kidneys)


## The rest is OK

-   Otherwise, unremarkable
-   The remainder of ... is/are unremarkable.

## Limited evaluation

**Ultrasound study**

`Limited evaluation` due to ...

-   patient's condition
-   high liver position
-   overlying bowel gas

## DDx

(These findings are ...)

**Sure**

-   `[consistent | compatible]` with A
-   `[suggesting | suggestive]` of A

-   likely A
-   most likely representing A

**Maybe**

-   `[probably = possibly > could be]` A, B, or C

## IMP Tricks

**IMPRESSION:**

**Won't describe:** _____ as mentioned above.

## Suggestion

-   (+) Follow-up is advised.

-   (+) Please correlate with clinical findings.

-   (+) Further (evaluation by) ... is recommended.

-   (+) Further dedicated contrasted CT/MRI is advised for characterization. 


## Describe Focal Lesions

-   **Amount:**

    -   Solitary/single
    -   Multiple (diffuse, segmental, lobar...)

-   **Size:**

    -   **Precise:** A `?-cm` cyst
    -   **Not precise:** cyst, measuring `about` ? cm.
    -   **Range:** `ranging from` ? - ? 
    -   **Largest one:** `up to` ? cm.

-   **Shape:**

    -   round, oval, lobulated, irregular

-   **Contour & Delimination:**

    -  **Contour:** smooth, irregular
    -   **Delimination** from adjacent parenchyma: `well | ill`-defined

-   **Location**

-   **Echogenicity | Density** (+ enhancement)

## Many Items Tricks

`Multi-subj` + `Verb`

**Ex:**

The findings about `A` **with** (associated) `B`, `C`, **and** `D`, **as well as** `E`
